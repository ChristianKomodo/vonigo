# Vonigo Theme UI in HTML/CSS

This is the repo for a site I created to match a design from Dribbble as an example of my work - converting an image to HTML/CSS and a little JS.  It's a basic UI and some Bootstrap classes, and I created some animated SVG icons in Illustrator for the navigation.  The live site is here: http://sectorfive.com/theme/.  It should be compared and viewed **at no less than 1475px wide,** since it was built to match a design, not to be a complete Responsive site.

Here is the image from the original designer [on Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/shots/1487200-Vonigo-Dashboard):
